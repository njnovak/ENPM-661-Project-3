Instructions:

To run this program, simply run the main.py file, making usre all libraries are installed.

Next, enter the collision radius, the starting x and y points, and the ending x and y points. The file will produce an avi movie that will
show the exploration and pathing actions within it. Commenting out the line with "cv2.imshow()" and "cv2.waitKey()"
in it will also display this at the end of the program.

Common error resolutions:
Make sure the collision radius is not too big and that the points lie within a 400-x and 250-y box.

If the program does not stop running, try quitting and restarting the program.
